# Student Score Analyzer (Java Project)

This Java program reads student names and their Math and Physics scores from a file (`score.txt`). It calculates average scores for each subject and allows the user to select either Math or Physics. It then identifies and displays students who scored above the average in the selected subject, and saves those results to a separate file (`above.txt`).

## Features

- Reads structured input from a file using `Scanner`
- Uses arrays (`String[]`, `int[]`) to store student data
- Calculates averages for Math and Physics
- Lets the user choose which subject to analyze
- Prints students who scored above average
- Saves the result to `above.txt`

## Input Format â€” score.txt

Each line should include a student's name, Math score, and Physics score:
